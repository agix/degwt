#summary Reporting tool for GWTs Lightweight Metrics

= Introduction =
[http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideLightweightMetrics.html GWTs Lightweight Metrics] is a great mechanism to instrument and capture data, but including it in a project is cumbersome. GWT Metrics plugs into the lightweight metrics system, collates the data, and reports it either in firebug or in a YUI Log Console. Since its just a javascript file, it can be loaded via a Bookmarklet. This makes it possible to see metrics on any GWT website without changing a single line of code.


= Bookmarklet Installation =
<wiki:gadget url="https://degwt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static/xml/gwtmetrics-gadget.xml" height="200" border="0" />

= Standalone Installation =
The bookmarklet installation has limitations - its difficult to see the metrics generated at startup. To get around that, place the following two lines of code in your host html file _just before_ your module.nocache.js script tag.

{{{
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="http://degwt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static/js/gwtmetrics.js"></script>
<script>gwtmetrics('firebug');</script>
}}}

You should include these two lines only during development and testing. Also, you may want to save the javascript file locally.

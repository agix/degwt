#summary Technical Information on how the de-obfuscation process works

= How DeGWT Works =

DeGWT is a javascript library that de-obfuscates GWT generated javascript code. In general, the code makes assumptions on how GWT generates code, and then uses them to generate unobfuscated code. This page documents these assumptions.

== Comparing Pretty and Obfuscated Javascript Code ==
GWT can generate javascript code in three styles - Obfuscated (default), Pretty and Detailed. Most of the reverse engineering is done by comparing the Pretty output to the Obfuscated output. Therefore, it is important to understand the pretty output.

In general, the difference between Pretty and Obfuscated javascript are the following -
# All classes and methods are renamed. Typically, classes and methods have 2 or 3 letter names.
# All strings are inlined. If pretty js has code like `$addString(streamWriter, 'greetServer')`, in obfuscated mode it will become something like `aG(pQ, rS);`.
# Here, the method `$addString` and the variable `streamWriter` were renamed, and the String "greetServer" was stored in a variable rS, and then the variable was used instead.
